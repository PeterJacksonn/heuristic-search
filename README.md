# Heuristic Search

### The Weights and Load Problem:

There are three lorries (A, B, and C) used to transport bricks from one point to another. 

You have 20 groups of bricks, of which have different weights.  

Assuming there is no maximum load for the lorries, but all lorries should be loaded with a number of bricks that weights are divided equally (or as equal as possible).

Employ a heuristic search method (Random Restart Hill Climbing) to solve the problem.
